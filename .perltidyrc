# For best results with indentation, configure your editor as follows:
#
# .vimrc:
#
# 	set tabstop=4	"An indentation level every four columns"
# 	set expandtab	"Convert all tabs typed into spaces"
# 	set shiftwidth=4	"Indent/outdent by four columns"
# 	set shiftround	"Always indent/outdent to the nearest tabstop"
#
# .emacs (using "cperl" mode):
#
# 	;; 4 space indents in cperl mode
# 	'(cperl-close-paren-offset -4)
# 	'(cperl-continued-statement-offset 4)
# 	'(cperl-indent-level 4)
# 	'(cperl-indent-parens-as-block t)
# 	'(cperl-tab-always-indent t)
